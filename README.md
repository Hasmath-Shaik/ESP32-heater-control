# ESP32-Based Heater Control System 🌡️🔥

This is a simple embedded system project to control a smart heater using temperature thresholds on ESP32. The project was developed as part of an internship assignment.

## 📌 Features

- ESP32 with DHT22 sensor
- LED represents heater ON/OFF
- Buzzer alerts during overheat
- 5 defined states: Idle, Heating, Stabilizing, Target Reached, Overheat
- Serial logging

## 🛠️ Circuit Diagram

See the `diagram.json` and `/screenshots` folder.

## 📂 Files Included

- `sketch.ino` - Arduino C code for ESP32
- `block-dig` - Circuit layout file from Wokwi
- `Heater control systems` - Output & circuit screenshots and more 
- `README.md` - This file
